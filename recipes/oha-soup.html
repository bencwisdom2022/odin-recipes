    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Ora (Oha) soup is native to the South Eastern Nigeria. 
        It is a very traditional soup similar to the 
        bitterleaf soup but cooked with Ora leaves.</p> 
        <p>Ora (Oha) Soup is special because the tender ora leaves 
            used in preparing this soup recipe are seasonal unlike 
            their bitterleaf counterpart which can be found all year round.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Oha leaf</li>
            <li>cocoyam paste</li>
            <li>ogiri</li>
            <li>azu</li>
            <li>meat</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by boiling your meats, 
                start with the tougher meats 
                like Cow leg and Shaki first.</li>
            <li>While the meats are boiling, 
                boil the Cocoyam with the skin on. 
                Do not add salt, boil till tender, 
                this should take roughly 
                20 minutes on medium heat…</li>
            <li>When they are soft, 
                gently peel the skin off and pound 
                till smooth in a mortar. 
                Alternatively, chop them into 
                small chunks and purée in your 
                electric blender or food 
                processor till smooth, 
                then set aside</li>
        </ol>
