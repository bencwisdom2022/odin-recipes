    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Bitter Leaf Soup, also known as Ofe Onugbu is a popular Nigerian soup. 
        Bitter leaf Soup is peculiar to the Igbo tribe of Eastern Nigeria. 
        A lot of non-Igbos shy away from bitter leaf soup (Well,  
        I did for the longest time) because they think that, 
        true to it’s name, it is a very bitter soup. But they can’t be more wrong.</p> 
        <p>Ofe Onugbu does not taste bitter in the slightest. 
            The leaves have to be thoroughly washed to get rid of the bitterness 
            before it’s added to the soup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Onugbu leaf</li>
            <li>cocoyam paste</li>
            <li>ogiri</li>

            <li>meat</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by boiling your meats, 
                start with the tougher meats 
                like Cow leg and Shaki first.</li>
            <li>While the meats are boiling, 
                boil the Cocoyam with the skin on. 
                Do not add salt, boil till tender, 
                this should take roughly 
                20 minutes on medium heat…</li>
            <li>When they are soft, 
                gently peel the skin off and pound 
                till smooth in a mortar. 
                Alternatively, chop them into 
                small chunks and purée in your 
                electric blender or food 
                processor till smooth, 
                then set aside</li>
        </ol>
